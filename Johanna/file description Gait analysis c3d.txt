Documentation for "gait analysis c3d.py"

Purpose of this code is to extract the valuable data from the c3d gait analysis files, manipulate them, and add the data into the sqlite database

LAST UPDATED: 15/09/2020

KEY VARIABLES:

Motion_Analysis.db =	 			database for Motion analysis data
patientID =					Patient ID
GaitAnalysis_Max_Min = 				Table in Motion_Analysis.db which holds max and min values
trial1c3d, trial2c3d, trial3c3d = 		name of the c3d files containing data of trial 1,2, 3
t1_lknee, t1_lhip, t1_lankle... = 		seperated values for trial one for each limb and each joint
t1_max_lk, t1_max_lh,t1_max_la,... = 		Max values for each trial, limb and joint
t1_min_lk, t1_min_lh,t1_min_la,... =		Min values for each trial, limb and joint
av_max_rk, av_min_rk,..... = 			Average values for max an min for each limb and each joint

import btk
import sqlite3


SQlite is initialised and the table GaitAnalysis_Max_Min is created with the following columns containing the following datatypes:
Patient_ID INTEGER, 
Trial_number INTEGER, 
Trial_Type TEXT
max_knee_left REAL, 
min_knee_left REAL,
max_hip_left REAL, 
min_hip_left REAL,
max_ankle_left REAL, 
min_ankle_left REAL, 
max_knee_right REAL, 
min_knee_right REAL,
max_hip_right REAL, 
min_hip_right REAL,
max_ankle_right REAL, 
min_ankle_right REAL

VitalData table
Patient_ID INTEGER, 
Trial_Type TEXT
av_min_leftk REAL, 
av_min_lefth REAL, 
av_min_lefta REAL, 
av_min_rightk REAL,
av_min_righth REAL, 
av_min_righta REAL,
av_max_leftk REAL, 
av_max_lefth REAL,
av_max_lefta REAL, 
av_max_rightk REAL,
av_max_righth REAL,
av_max_righta REAL

The patient ID, Trial Type and limb are inputted by the user
**This should potentially be ammended to add these in a GUI or with more loops to ensure spelling is correct**

File uses data aquired directly from the c3d file using the btk package. The file names are inputted in in their c3d format. 
The extractvalues function is used to extract the values from each trial into seperate arrays for each limb and each joint (18 arrays)
**Currently set with default as a sample c3d file which needs to be removed before the final product**

The max and min values for each of the 18 arrays are calculated to give 36 new variables. These values are rounded to 3 decimals. 
The average of the max and min for each limb are calculated and also rounded to 3 decimal points.

The data is loaded into the two tables
